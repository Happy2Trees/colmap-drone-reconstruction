# CoTracker Sliding Window Implementation Todo

## 🎯 Project Goal
Implement sliding window-based feature tracking using CoTracker3 on light emitter block images (x3 magnification, section2) with optimal performance and overlap strategy.

## 📊 Data Overview
- **Input Images**: 3,837 frames in `/data/light_emitter_block_x3/section2/`
- **Image Format**: Sequential JPG files (00000.jpg - 03836.jpg)
- **Task**: Extract dense point trajectories across the entire sequence

## 🏗️ Architecture Design

### Model Selection
- **Primary Model**: CoTracker3 Online (sliding window optimized)
  - Window length: 16 frames
  - Default step: 8 frames (50% overlap)
  - Memory efficient for long sequences
- **Fallback Model**: CoTracker3 Offline (for quality comparison)
  - Window length: 60 frames
  - Higher accuracy but more memory intensive

### Window Strategy
```
Window Configuration:
- Window Size: 24 frames (1.5x default for better temporal context)
- Overlap: 12 frames (50% overlap)
- Grid Density: 15x15 points (balanced density/performance)
- Support Grid: Enabled (6x6 auxiliary points for stability)

Example:
Window 1: frames [0-23]
Window 2: frames [12-35] (12 frame overlap)
Window 3: frames [24-47] (12 frame overlap)
...
```

## 🔬 Phase 3.6: SIFT-Based Feature Tracking Implementation 🆕

### Motivation
- Uniform grid tracking includes many points in textureless regions leading to unstable tracks
- SIFT features are naturally detected at textured regions with strong gradients
- Better tracking stability on edges, corners, and textured areas

### Implementation Details ✅
- [x] Create SIFT-based test script (`tests/cotracker_tests/test_cotracker_sift.py`)
  - [x] Extract SIFT features for each window's first frame
  - [x] Use SIFT keypoint locations as CoTracker query points
  - [x] Filter features for good spatial distribution (grid-based filtering)
  - [x] Maintain similar visualization style with "S" labels for SIFT points
  - [x] Maximum 400 SIFT features per window
  - [x] Fallback to grid if no SIFT features found

### Key Differences from Grid-Based Approach
1. **Feature Selection**: 
   - Grid: Uniform 20x20 grid (400 points)
   - SIFT: Up to 400 SIFT keypoints in textured regions

2. **Spatial Distribution**:
   - Grid: Fixed uniform spacing
   - SIFT: Adaptive to image content, concentrated in textured areas

3. **Expected Benefits**:
   - More stable tracking in textured regions
   - Avoids wasting computation on textureless areas
   - Natural feature selection based on image gradients

### Visualization Enhancements
